			"quote": "I've forgotten more winning hands than you've ever played.",
			"name": "Mrs Chen",
			"description": "Mrs. Chen is a no-nonsense Mahjong veteran who’s been crushing tables since before you were born. Fiercely strategic and a little terrifying, she commands respect with just a look — and her grumpy cat is just as judgmental. Underestimate her at your own risk."

		"uncleCai": {
			"quote": "While you're counting tiles, I'm counting my wins.",
			"name": "Uncle Cai",
			"description": "Uncle Cai is a streetwise Mahjong master who’s seen it all — and usually wins it all. Laid-back with a sharp mind, he prefers to fan himself and let others sweat. His old-school swag, gold chain, and deadpan humor make him a legend both at the table and on the streets."
