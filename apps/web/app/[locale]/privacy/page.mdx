- **Consent:** Where you have given us clear consent for us to process your personal data for a specific purpose (e.g., for marketing communications). You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time.
- **Performance of a Contract:** Where the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract (e.g., to provide our services).
- **Legal Obligation:** Where the processing is necessary for us to comply with a legal or regulatory obligation (e.g., for tax purposes or to prevent fraud).
- **Legitimate Interests:** Where the processing is necessary for our legitimate interests or those of a third party, provided your fundamental rights and interests do not override those interests (e.g., for improving our services, for fraud prevention, or for direct marketing where permitted by law). We ensure we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our legitimate interests.

## 6. Sharing Your Personal Data

We may share your personal data with the following categories of third parties for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy:

- **Service Providers:** We work with third-party service providers who perform services on our behalf, such as:
  - **Email Marketing:** [Emailoctopus](https://emailoctopus.com/)

- **Legal and Regulatory Authorities:** We may disclose your personal data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency).
- **Business Transfers:** In the event of a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your personal data may be transferred as part of that transaction.

## 7. International Data Transfers

As Wasabi Games DMCC is based in Dubai, UAE, and we use global service providers, your personal data may be transferred to, stored, and processed in countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA) or the UK, which may not have the same level of data protection laws as your home country.

Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA or UK, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by implementing appropriate safeguards, such as:

- Transferring data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection for personal data by the European Commission or the UK government (adequacy decisions).
- Using specific contracts approved by the European Commission or the UK government which give personal data the same protection it has in Europe (Standard Contractual Clauses - SCCs).

Please contact us if you want further information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA or UK.

## 8. Data Security

We have implemented appropriate technical and organisational security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. We store your data with reputable third-party providers who adhere to high security standards.

Despite our efforts, no security system is impenetrable. We cannot guarantee the absolute security of your data transmitted to our site; any transmission is at your own risk.

## 9. Data Retention

We will retain your personal data for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.

This generally means we will keep your data for the duration of your relationship with us (e.g., as long as you have an active account or subscription), and for a reasonable period thereafter to allow us to resolve disputes, enforce our agreements, or comply with our legal obligations. If you unsubscribe from our marketing communications or request deletion of your data, we will delete or anonymise your data, unless we are legally required or permitted to retain certain data for a longer period.

## 10. Your Rights as a Data Subject

Under GDPR, you have the following rights regarding your personal data:

- **The Right to Access:** You have the right to request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.
- **The Right to Rectification:** You have the right to request that we correct any inaccurate or incomplete personal data we hold about you.
- **The Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten):** You have the right to request that we delete your personal data, under certain conditions.
- **The Right to Restrict Processing:** You have the right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data, under certain conditions.
- **The Right to Data Portability:** You have the right to request that we transfer the data that we have collected to another organisation, or directly to you, under certain conditions.
- **The Right to Object:** You have the right to object to our processing of your personal data, under certain conditions, particularly where we are relying on legitimate interests as the legal basis for processing.
- **The Right to Withdraw Consent:** Where we rely on your consent to process your personal data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. This will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before you withdraw your consent.

## 11. How to Exercise Your Rights and Contact Us

If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, or if you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or our privacy practices, please contact us at:

**Email:** [hello@mahjongstars.com](mailto:hello@mahjongstars.com)

We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month. Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

## 12. Cookies

Our website uses cookies and similar tracking technologies to enhance your experience. Cookies are small text files placed on your device to collect standard Internet log information and visitor behaviour information. We use cookies for:

- **Analytics:** To understand how visitors interact with our website, which helps us improve its functionality and content (e.g., posthog analytics, vercel analytics).
- **Advertising:** To deliver relevant advertisements to you.
- **Session Management:** To keep you logged in and remember your preferences.

You can set your browser not to accept cookies, and the above websites tell you how to remove cookies from your browser. However, in a few cases, some of our website features may not function as a result.
