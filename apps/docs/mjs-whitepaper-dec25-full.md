# 1 Introduction

## 1.1 Overview of Mahjong Stars

Mahjong Stars is a revolutionary web3 social competitive hybrid Al-powered multiplayer
Mahjong platform built with a scalable blockchain ecosystem. The project is
spearheaded by Mahjong industry leaders having spent almost 20+ years in the space.
Prior to Mahjong Stars they created one of the world's most successful online Mahjong
games. Now, they aim to make Mahjong Stars THE most successful Mahjong platform in
the world. We are seeking to introduce the timeless game of Mahjong to a global
audience by combining the strategic depth and cultural richness of traditional Mahjong
with cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence, decentralized ledger
systems, digital and physical asset ownership. By leveraging these technologies,
Mahjong Stars offers a transparent, fair and accessible gaming environment for players
of all skill levels.

Mahjong Stars treats Mahjong as a competitive mind sport rather than a casino-style
product, emphasizing strategy, probability and social interaction. At its core, Mahjong
Stars is designed to be more than just a game it is an ecosystem. The platform
features a dual currency system, where a soft currency (in-game credits) supports
day-to-day gameplay, acquisitions and upgrades, while a separate blockchain-based
token serves as a governance and marketplace asset. This dual-currency system allows
Mahjong Stars to appeal to both casual players who simply wish to enjoy Mahjong and
competitive or investor-oriented participants who are interested in the broader economic
opportunities afforded by blockchain technology.

In addition to the token economy, Mahjong Stars integrates a unique hybrid Al system
that learns from player behaviour and enables personalised Al companions capable of
playing on behalf of the user. This Al system is not simply a generic bot; it is trained to
mimic the player's own strategies, risk tolerance and decision-making processes. As
such, Al companions can compete effectively when the player is offline, creating a
persistent gaming environment and a new layer of strategic depth.

- The Game Layer: a skill based Mahjong platform powered by soft currency and Al
  assisted gameplay.
- The asset & Governance Layer: blockchain enabled ownership, governance and
  marketplaces.

This separation ensures accessibility for non-crypto users while enabling advanced
game play and features for those who opt in.

## 1.2 The Game of Mahjong: Cultural Significance and Global Appeal

Mahjong is a tile-based game that originated in China and has been played for over a
century. Its rules involve strategic tile-matching, pattern recognition and a balance of
offensive and defensive tactics. With variations such as Riichi (Japanese), Cantonese

(Hong Kong), American and Singaporean Mahjong, the game has adapted to diverse
cultural contexts while retaining its fundamental appeal.

Cultural Significance: The game is deeply embedded in the social fabric of East Asian
cultures, often associated with family gatherings, celebrations and intellectual
competition. Its ability to bring people together across generations has turned Mahjong
into a cultural icon.

Global Appeal: Today, Mahjong is played by hundreds of millions worldwide. Experts
estimate that at least 600 million people enjoy the game. The spread of Mahjong to
Western countries, along with the rise of digital platforms, has fueled its continued
popularity. Mahjong's combination of skill, chance and social interaction appeals to a
broad audience, making it ripe for innovation.

## 1.3 Vision and Mission

The vision of Mahjong Stars is to become the premier global destination for online
Mahjong gaming, offering a seamless, engaging and rewarding experience that honours
the game's cultural heritage while embracing the possibilities of modern technology.

The project's mission is built on several pillars:

- Inclusivity and Accessibility: Provide an intuitive and accessible platform that
  caters to both beginners and seasoned Mahjong players. By offering interactive
  tutorials, an intelligent coaching system and various play modes, Mahjong Stars
  aims to reduce the barriers to entry and make Mahjong more approachable for new
  players.
- Innovation through Al: Leverage artificial intelligence not merely as a bot opponent
  but as a personalised companion. The Al system in Mahjong Stars is designed to
  learn from each player, evolve with them and extend the gameplay experience
  beyond human limits. Whether acting as a coach or playing on behalf of the user, Al
  is integrated as a core gameplay feature rather than an afterthought.
- True Ownership and Economic Opportunity: Blockchain technology provides
  players with verifiable ownership of in-game assets. Certain characters, charms and
  studios exist as unique digital items that can be traded, collected and upgraded. By
  separating the governance token from the game's operational structure, Mahjong
  Stars supports a compliant and sustainable economy where players can participate
  without compulsory investment in crypto.
- Community and Competition: Encourage social interaction and competitive spirit
  through robust community features. Leaderboards, ranked matches, tournaments
  and clan-based competitions are designed to foster a sense of belonging and rivalry.
  The platform will nurture a vibrant community that drives player retention and organic
  growth.
- Fairness and Transparency: Ensure that the game remains fair and secure by
  using provably random tile distributions, experience-based match making and a
  freemium play category. Fairness is critical to maintaining trust among players,
  hence providing a nest for new players and seasoned to enjoy their preferred version
  of Mahjong.

With these pillars, Mahjong Stars aims to create an ecosystem that not only appeals to
Mahjong enthusiasts but also attracts actors seeking exposure to a unique convergence
of gaming, Al and blockchain technologies.

# 2 Market Opportunity

## 2.1 Global Mahjong Landscape

The global Mahjong landscape is vast yet fragmented. While Mahjong is popular in
China, Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia and other regions, online platforms often cater to
specific variants and regional rule sets. Many existing platforms lack the social and
competitive features that modern gamers expect, and few offer seamless cross-variant
play.

Furthermore, online Mahjong games have historically struggled with fairness and
transparency, with some platforms facing allegations of rigged algorithms or unfair
matching systems.

Mahjong Stars addresses these challenges by providing:

- Unified yet Customisable Rulesets: The platform supports multiple popular
  variants (such as Riichi and Bang Bang) and plans to expand to American,
  Cantonese and Singaporean versions. Players can select their preferred variant or
  create customised lobbies, enabling play across cultures while preserving
  authenticity.
- Cross-Cultural Community: By hosting players from around the globe, Mahjong
  Stars facilitates cultural exchange and healthy competition. Clan structures and chat
  channels allow regional communities to flourish without isolating them from the wider
  player base.
- Fair Play Guarantees: Transparent randomisation processes ensure that all players
  compete on a level playing field, addressing common complaints in existing Mahjong
  apps.

## 2.2 Market Potential and Growth Projections

The gaming industry is one of the fastest-growing entertainment sectors worldwide.
According to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global gaming market was
valued at USD 281.77 billion in 2023 and is projected to reach USD 665.77 billion by
2030, reflecting a compound annual growth rate of around 13%. Several factors
contribute to this growth:

- Increasing Internet and Smartphone Penetration: More people have access to
  high-quality internet and mobile devices, particularly in emerging markets where
  Mahjong is already popular.
- Rise of Esports and Social Gaming: Competitive gaming and streaming have
  turned games into spectator sports, attracting sponsorships and advertising revenue.
- Innovation in Al and Cloud Gaming: Al-powered gameplay and cloud
  infrastructure allow for more sophisticated experiences and reduced hardware
  requirements.
- Integration of Blockchain and Digital Assets: Gamers are increasingly interested
  in owning their digital assets, as evidenced by the rise of play-to-earn models.

For Mahjong Stars specifically, the market opportunity lies at the intersection of these
trends. By offering Al-powered gameplay, blockchain-backed ownership and a social

competitive environment, the platform positions itself to capture both traditional Mahjong
fans and new players drawn by technological innovation.

## 2.3 Competitive Advantages of Mahjong Stars

Mahjong Stars differentiates itself through a combination of features that are rarely seen
together in the current market:

- Hybrid Al System: Rather than using generic bots, Mahjong Stars employs a
  sophisticated Al that learns directly from human players. This Al can coach, mimic
  and compete on behalf of players, creating a dynamic environment where human
  and Al strategies co-evolve.
- Decentralised Ownership: By representing characters, charms and studios as
  unique digital assets on a blockchain, the platform grants players true ownership,
  allowing assets to be traded or sold outside of the game. This stands in contrast to
  traditional games where items are bound to a player's account and can be revoked
  at any time.
- Soft Currency Economy: The use of an earnable in-game currency allows new
  players to participate fully without requiring crypto purchases. This inclusive model
  encourages user acquisition and offers a less speculative alternative to purely
  token-driven games.
- Global Social Ecosystem: Through features like friend lists, chat, private rooms
  and clan competitions, Mahjong Stars emphasises community building. The platform
  encourages players to form teams, organise events and share content, driving
  organic growth and retention.
- Fair and Transparent Mechanics: Provably fair algorithms, Al-based anti-cheat
  measures and transparent governance processes build trust among players and
  investors.

## 2.4 Target Audience

Mahjong Stars targets multiple user segments:

- Casual Players and Beginners: People who enjoy Mahjong socially or wish to learn
  the game. Features such as tutorials and Al coaching lower the barrier to entry.
- Competitive Players and Mahjong Enthusiasts: Experienced players seeking
  high-stakes tournaments, ranked matches and a sophisticated competitive
  environment.
- Collectors and Traders: Users interested in collecting and trading digital assets,
  limited-edition characters or charms. The studio system appeals to players who
  enjoy managing multiple avatars and strategies.
- Investors and Token Holders: The Web3 audience is one of the most risk tolerant
  and interactive to date. They can be considered as one of the highest quality users
  any game can acquire. For these reasons Mahjong Stars must accommodate In
  order to become THE most successful, online version of mahjong in the world.

Estimated number of players: 600 - 700 Million

Adressable market by Mahjong stars (via digital): 80 - 120 Million

Initial target users: 5 - 10 Million competitive and social players

# 3 Product Overview

Mahjong Stars' product offering is designed to deliver a comprehensive and engaging
gameplay experience while providing a robust framework for future expansion. This
section covers gameplay mechanics, Al integration, digital assets and social features in
detail.

## 3.1 Gameplay Mechanics

### 3.1.1 Supported Mahjong Variants

Mahjong Stars recognises that Mahjong has many regional variants, each with unique
rules and scoring systems. The platform aims to support the most popular versions and
provide customisation options for house rules. The initial launch focuses on:

- Riichi (Japanese Mahjong): Known for its strategic depth, Riichi features complex
  scoring patterns, concealed hands and the riichi declaration. It appeals to
  competitive players who enjoy intricate tactical play. Mahjong Stars implements
  Riichi with official tournament rules and optional house rule variations.
- Bang Bang (Casual Mahjong): This variant simplifies certain aspects of Mahjong to
  make the game more accessible for beginners. Bang Bang emphasises fast play,
  straightforward scoring and a shorter learning curve, making it ideal for casual and
  social matches.

Future updates will introduce additional rule sets, including but not limited to:

- Cantonese/Hong Kong Mahjong: A popular variant in Southern China and Hong
  Kong with flower tiles and a fan-based scoring system.
- American Mahjong: Featuring Jokers and special combinations, American Mahjong
  differs significantly from Asian rule sets. It is widely played in the United States and
  has a dedicated following.
- Singaporean and Korean Variants: These versions offer unique tile sets and play
  dynamics. Adding them will broaden Mahjong Stars' appeal in different regions.

By offering multiple rule sets, the platform ensures inclusivity and fosters cross-regional
play. Players can host matches using their preferred rules, attracting friends and
communities from around the world.

### 3.1.2 Casual and Competitive Play Modes

Mahjong Stars provides a variety of play modes to cater to different player preferences:

- Casual Matches: For those who want a relaxed experience, casual matches can be
  set up quickly with friends or strangers. Players can choose table settings, including
  the number of rounds, time limits and stake levels. Casual play emphasises fun and
  social interaction over ranking and rewards.
- Ranked Games: Competitive players can participate in ranked games that
  contribute to their global ranking. The ranking system considers win rates, skill level
  and match difficulty. Rankings reset periodically to ensure fairness and give new
  players an opportunity to climb the leaderboards.

- Tournaments: Mahjong Stars hosts daily, weekly and seasonal tournaments with
  various formats, such as single-elimination, Swiss or round-robin. Tournaments offer
  larger prize pools, including rare characters, charm bundles or soft currency. Some
  tournaments may require entry fees (paid in soft currency or tokens) and feature
  multi-round events culminating in live-streamed finals.
- Practice and Training Mode: Beginners can practice against Al opponents at
  varying difficulty levels. Training mode includes optional hints and allows players to
  replay and analyse hands with built-in tools.
- Private Rooms: Players can create password-protected tables to play with friends,
  apply house rules or host club events. Private rooms support voice chat and video
  integration, replicating the feel of a real-world Mahjong parlour.

### 3.1.3 Tournaments, Leaderboards and Ranked Matches

Tournaments and ranking systems are essential for sustaining a competitive community.
Mahjong Stars implements:

- Global Leaderboards: A real-time leaderboard displays top players across different
  categories, including casual rating, ranked rating, clan ranking and Al performance
  ranking. Leaderboards increase visibility for skilled players and encourage others to
  improve.
- Seasonal Rankings: Rankings are divided into seasons, with resets and rewards at
  the end of each season. Seasonal resets prevent dominant players from holding the
  top spots indefinitely and motivate continuous play. Rewards may include exclusive
  cosmetics, characters or studio slots.
- Multi-tier Tournaments: Daily tournaments offer quick competitions with small entry
  fees and modest prizes. Weekly tournaments provide larger prize pools and longer
  formats. Seasonal championships serve as flagship events, featuring qualifiers, live
  broadcasts and substantial rewards.
- Clan Competitions: Clans can compete in clan-only tournaments, where teams of
  players accumulate points based on individual performances. Clan competitions
  foster teamwork and cross-player strategy development.

### 3.1.4 Addressing Current Online Mahjong Issues

Existing online Mahjong platforms face several challenges:

- Lack of Fairness: Some platforms have been accused of bias in tile distributions or
  matching algorithms, undermining trust.
- Limited Regional Support: Many games restrict players to regional rule sets,
  limiting global interaction.
- Absence of High-Level Competition: Few platforms offer robust tournament
  systems or meaningful rankings.
- Poor Monetisation Models: Pay-to-win mechanics or excessive advertising drive
  away serious players.

Mahjong Stars addresses these issues by:

- Implementing fair randomisation by enabling each player to have their own Al,
  trained on their own behavior and level of skill there are no bots of which could be
  rigged.
- Supporting multiple rule sets and customisation, encouraging cross-regional play.

- Offering structured competitive modes with attractive rewards and clear rankings.
- Employing a soft currency system that allows players to earn upgrades through
  gameplay rather than purchases. Optional purchases are limited to cosmetic items,
  digital collectibles, table fees and entry fees for larger tournaments.

## 3.2 Hybrid Al Integration

The integration of artificial intelligence sets Mahjong Stars apart. Rather than relying on
static bots, the platform uses a dynamic Al system that evolves with player input and
generates personalised experiences. Al in Mahjong Stars operates at several levels:

### 3.2.1 Al-Assisted Gameplay and Strategy Hints

During matches, the Al monitors the game state, player decisions and available tiles. It
then provides:

- Real-Time Hints: Players can toggle hints to receive subtle suggestions on tile
  discards, meld opportunities or risk assessments. Hints are context-sensitive and
  adjust to the player's level, ensuring that novices receive more guidance while
  experienced players are given high-level insights.
- Post-Game Analysis: After each match, the Al generates a report highlighting key
  decisions, strategic mistakes and alternative lines of play. Players can review
  replays, examine the Al's recommendations and share analyses with friends or
  coaches.
- Adaptive Learning: The Al learns from the player's responses to hints. If a player
  consistently ignores certain advice, the Al adjusts its recommendations. Over time,
  hints become finely tuned to each individual's learning style.

### 3.2.2 Personalized Al Players and Offline Competition

Beyond coaching, Mahjong Stars introduces Al companions that simulate the player's
own style. This feature operates as follows:

- Data Collection: When a player participates in matches, the Al collects data on
  decisions, timing, pattern recognition, risk tolerance and tile combinations. The data
  is anonymised and stored securely.
- Behaviour Modeling: The Al uses machine learning to identify patterns in the
  player's behaviour, constructing a behavioural model. This model captures high-level
  decision heuristics as well as subtle tendencies, such as preference for certain
  melds or risk profiles.
- Al Companion Creation: Once sufficient data is gathered, the player can instantiate
  an Al companion. This Al is linked to a chosen character asset and can participate in
  matches autonomously. The Al's performance evolves as more data is collected and
  as the player trains it through feedback or additional matches.
- Offline Play: Players can deploy their Al companions to compete in matches or
  tournaments when they are offline. The Al will earn soft currency, rewards or ranking

points on behalf of the user. Players can set risk thresholds, specify play modes
(casual, ranked or tournament) and monitor Al performance remotely.

- Al Rental and Team Play: Advanced players may choose to rent their trained Al
  companions to others. Rental fees can be paid in soft currency or tokens, with the
  platform taking a small commission. Teams of Al companions can also participate in
  special events where coordinated Al behaviour is required.

### 3.2.3 Fairness and Game Dynamics Enhancement

Al is also deployed to maintain fairness and balance across the platform. The system
monitors player behaviour, tile distributions and match outcomes to detect anomalies
such as:

- Collusion or Teaming: If players repeatedly form partnerships to target others, the
  Al flags the behaviour and intervenes. Penalties may include temporary suspensions
  or reduced rewards.
- Cheating or Bots: External cheating software or bots that attempt to exploit the
  game are identified through pattern analysis. Accounts using such tools are
  investigated and sanctioned.
- Strategy Dominance: The Al analyses meta trends and win rates to ensure that no
  single strategy becomes overwhelmingly dominant. If a particular tile combination or
  playstyle appears unbalanced, developers can adjust game parameters to
  reintroduce diversity.

This dynamic monitoring maintains a healthy competitive environment and reduces
opportunities for exploitation.

### 3.2.4 Innovative Gameplay Features

To further elevate the Mahjong experience, Mahjong Stars introduces innovations such
as:

- 24/7 Liquidity: With Al companions able to play on behalf of users, there are always
  active matches available. Players no longer wait for opponents; they can join tables
  instantly at any time.
- Hybrid Play Mode: Players can switch seamlessly between manual and Al-driven
  play. For example, a player might start a match manually, then hand control over to
  their Al companion mid-game if they need to step away.
- Clan Al Training: Clans can pool data to train clan-specific Al companions that
  embody collective strategies. These clan Als can compete in inter-clan tournaments,
  adding a layer of cooperative strategy and team identity.
- Al Customisation: Players can adjust their Al's aggression level, defensive
  tendencies and risk profile using simple sliders. Advanced users may access deeper
  settings or even design custom heuristics for their Al companions.

These innovations provide depth and variety, ensuring that Mahjong Stars remains
engaging for years to come.

## 3.3 Collectibles and Digital Assets

True ownership of in-game assets is also made possible by Mahjong Stars. By offering
the possibility to leverage blockchain technology, the platform allows players to possess,
trade and monetize their in-game items if the player wishes to. If the player does not,
then they may keep them as traditional in-game assets that still provide boosts or other
advantages within the gameplay. Collectibles fall into three main categories: characters,
charms and studios.

### 3.3.1 Character Assets: Acquisition, Leveling and Al Enablement

Characters serve as the primary avatars through which players engage with the game.
Each character asset has unique attributes, aesthetics and story elements that give it
personality. Character assets function as follows:

- Acquisition: Players obtain characters via soft currency purchases, token-backed
  sales, tournament rewards or special events. Some characters are common and
  easy to acquire, while others are rare or limited edition.
- Attributes and Skill Trees: Characters come with base attributes such as luck,
  strategy or social charisma. As players use their characters, they gain experience
  points, level up and unlock additional abilities or cosmetics. Skill trees might include
  sections for improving Al compatibility, boosting soft currency earnings or unlocking
  unique chat emojis.
- Al Slots: Each character has a certain number of Al slots, determining how many
  personalised Al companions can be attached. High-rarity characters may support
  multiple Al companions, enabling advanced strategies and team play.
- Evolution and Fusion: Players can merge duplicate characters to evolve them into
  higher-rarity versions. Evolution may change the character's appearance, unlock
  new voice lines or increase Al capacity.
- Narrative Lore: Characters are embedded within a narrative universe. Collecting
  different characters unlocks story chapters, deepening player engagement.

By combining gameplay utility with narrative appeal, character assets become desirable
collectibles that hold value both inside and outside the game.

### 3.3.2 Charm Assets: Rewards, Raffles and Passive Earning

Charms are supplementary items that grant bonuses or aesthetic flair. They are
designed to encourage consistent gameplay and provide players with long-term goals.

- Types of Charms: Charms come in various forms—some are purely cosmetic, such
  as table decorations or special tile designs; others offer gameplay benefits, like
  increased soft currency drop rates or enhanced character experience gain. Rare
  charms might grant access to exclusive tournaments or content.
- Acquisition: Charms are typically awarded through daily quests, achievements,
  raffles, or in special events. They may also drop randomly from winning matches or
  be purchasable with soft currency.
- Raffles and Loot Boxes: Mahjong Stars uses raffles to distribute rare charms.
  Players obtain raffle tickets through gameplay or purchase them with soft currency.
  Draws are provably random, and winning a raffle can yield valuable charms or even
  characters.
- Passive Earning: Charms can transform into the blockchain version in order to be
  staked in a rewards pool to earn additional soft currency or token rewards. The

staking mechanism encourages players to hold onto charms and participate in the
economic ecosystem.

- Charm Evolution: Similar to characters, charms can be combined or upgraded. For
  example, combining three common charms might yield one rare charm with
  enhanced benefits.

Charms add a collectible layer beyond characters, catering to players who enjoy
incremental progression and surprise rewards.

### 3.3.3 Studio Assets: Managing Multiple Characters and Al Assignment

Studios represent virtual spaces where players manage teams of characters and Al
companions. They are the pinnacle of collectible assets within Mahjong Stars and are
designed for players who want to orchestrate complex strategies.

- Acquisition: Studios are limited in number and are typically sold via auctions or
  high-tier tournament rewards. Owning a studio grants the right to host multiple
  characters and Al companions.
- Team Management: Within a studio, players organise characters into squads. Each
  squad can be assigned an Al companion, enabling simultaneous participation in
  multiple matches or tournaments. Studio owners can rotate characters and Al
  companions depending on the event.
- Al Training Facilities: Studios house Al training facilities where players can
  accelerate the learning process by providing targeted data sets or running simulated
  matches. Advanced analytics help fine-tune Al behaviours.
- Renting and Sponsorship: Studio owners may rent out unused characters or Al
  companions to other players, earning passive income. Studios can also become
  sponsors, providing characters to up-and-coming players in exchange for a share of
  their winnings.
- Customisation and Prestige: Studios can be visually customised with decorations,
  trophies and clan insignia. High-level studios gain prestige bonuses, such as
  increased soft currency earnings or enhanced training efficiency.

Studios appeal to players who enjoy strategy at a macro level, offering an avenue for
greater investment and deeper involvement in the ecosystem.

## 3.4 Social Features and Community Engagement

Mahjong is fundamentally a social game. Mahjong Stars builds upon this by providing a
comprehensive suite of social features to encourage interaction, collaboration and
community growth.

### 3.4.1 Chat Functionality and Friend Lists

Communication lies at the heart of any successful online community. Mahjong Stars
implements:

- Integrated Chat: An in-game chat system allows players to communicate before,
  during and after matches. Chats are separated into general channels, match-specific
  chats, clan channels and private messages. Moderation tools ensure respectful
  conduct.
- Friend Lists: Players can add friends and see when they are online. They can invite
  friends to casual matches, private rooms or tournaments. Friend lists also track
  recent opponents, making it easy to rematch or send messages after a game.
- Emotes and Stickers: To add personality to interactions, players can use emojis,
  animated stickers or custom phrases. Emojis can be earned through achievements
  or purchased with soft currency.
- Voice and Video Chat: Premium rooms or clan spaces may support integrated
  voice and video chat. These features simulate real-world Mahjong tables and allow
  for more dynamic communication.

### 3.4.2 Private Rooms and Customization Options

Private rooms allow players to create bespoke game environments:

- Customization: Room hosts can set rules, select Mahjong variants, determine time
  limits and choose visual themes. They can also pick background music or ambient
  sounds to enhance immersion.
- Invitations and Access Control: Hosts decide who can enter, using passwords or
  invitation lists. Private rooms support both casual play and high-stakes matches.
- Streaming Integration: Room hosts can stream their matches directly to platforms
  like Twitch or YouTube. Integrated overlays show player names, character avatars
  and real-time scores, making it easy to share gameplay with a broader audience.

### 3.4.3 Achievements, Replays and Social Media Integration

To reward continued engagement, Mahjong Stars offers a rich achievement system:

- Achievements: Players can earn badges and titles for milestones such as winning a
  certain number of matches, reaching high ranks, collecting sets of characters or
  solving specific in-game challenges. Achievements unlock rewards like soft currency,
  charms or exclusive emojis.
- Replays: Every match can be saved and rewatched. Replays highlight key
  moments, show statistical breakdowns and allow players to share game links with
  friends. Replays are an invaluable tool for studying strategy and improving play.
- Social Media Integration: Players can share achievements and replays directly on
  social platforms. Automated highlight clips make it easy to showcase thrilling wins or
  clever plays. Social sharing increases visibility for the platform and encourages
  friends to join.

Together, these social features transform Mahjong Stars from a solitary pastime into a
vibrant community.

# 4 Player Experience

Mahjong Stars is designed with players at the centre. This section outlines how the
platform ensures easy access, intuitive design and sustained engagement.

## 4.1 Accessibility and Account Management

### 4.1.1 Browser-Based Platform and Device Compatibility

Mahjong Stars is built as a web application, eliminating the need for downloads or
installations. Players can access the game from any modern browser on desktop, laptop,
tablet or mobile. Key advantages include:

- Immediate Access: New users can register and start playing within minutes,
  removing friction associated with app downloads.
- Cross-Device Play: A responsive design ensures the interface adapts to different
  screen sizes. Players can start a match on a computer and continue on a mobile
  phone without losing progress.
- Low Hardware Requirements: Because heavy computations are offloaded to cloud
  servers, Mahjong Stars runs smoothly on devices with modest specifications.

### 4.1.2 Account Creation and Wallet Integration

Creating an account on Mahjong Stars is straightforward:

- Standard Sign-Up: Users can register with an email address and password or log in
  via social media accounts like Google, Facebook or Apple.
- Wallet Setup: Although soft currency accounts are created automatically, players
  who wish to trade digital assets or interact with the token must link a compatible
  wallet (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet or native web wallet). In-platform guides assist
  users through wallet setup, address security best practices and recommend
  hardware wallets for added protection.
- Security Features: Account security can be enforced through multi-factor
  authentication, secure password storage and optional biometric logins on mobile
  devices.

### 4.1.3 Currency Options

Soft currency is the in-game credit that supports everyday gameplay. Players acquire
soft currency by winning matches, completing quests and selling items. They can also
purchase soft currency via conventional payment methods like credit cards or via token
conversion.

- Deposits: Players can buy soft currency packages with fiat currency or convert
  tokens into soft currency at market rates. Purchases are handled through secure
  payment gateways with fraud detection.
- Redemptions: Soft currency is primarily meant for in-game use and cannot be
  withdrawn directly as fiat. However, players can convert soft currency into digital
  assets (e.g., characters or charms) and redeem them on an independent

marketplace for tokens or fiat through third-party exchanges. This model prevents
potential abuse while still offering players a redemption route.

## 4.2 UI/UX Design and Player Engagement

### 4.2.1 Intuitive Interface and Multilingual Support

A clean, intuitive interface makes Mahjong Stars welcoming for new and veteran players
alike. The design focuses on clarity, minimal clutter and accessible menus. Key UI
features include:

- Dashboard: The home screen summarises the player's current ranking, recent
  matches, friends online and active events. A rotating banner highlights promotions,
  tournaments and new asset releases.
- Game Lobby: Match creation and discovery are streamlined. Players can filter
  tables by variant, stakes, difficulty or game speed. A quick-play button automatically
  matches users with others of similar skill.
- Inventory and Collections: A dedicated inventory page displays characters,
  charms and studios. Players can sort items by rarity, level or aesthetics and apply
  filters to quickly locate assets. A comparison tool helps players decide which
  characters to upgrade or trade.
- Settings and Customisation: Players can adjust sound, graphics, chat preferences
  and Al hint frequency. Accessibility settings allow colourblind modes, larger fonts and
  haptic feedback for mobile.
- Multilingual Support: To cater to a global audience, the interface is available in
  multiple languages, including English, Mandarin, Japanese, Korean, Spanish,
  French and Arabic. Additional languages will be added based on user demand.

### 4.2.2 Interactive Tutorials and Beginner-Friendly Features

Mahjong Stars recognises that Mahjong's complexity can deter new players. To address
this:

- Tutorial Modules: Step-by-step tutorials introduce the basic rules, hand structures,
  scoring and tile flow. Interactive exercises allow players to practice draws, discards
  and melds before entering real matches.
- Guided First Matches: New players can play their first few matches with Al hints
  permanently enabled. Explanations accompany each hint, clarifying why a particular
  move is recommended.
- Glossary and Knowledge Base: An in-app glossary defines Mahjong terms,
  common strategies and slang. Hyperlinks within tutorials connect players to relevant
  glossary entries, easing the learning curve.
- Beginner Lobbies: Dedicated beginner rooms ensure new players compete against
  others of similar skill, preventing discouraging experiences against experts.

### 4.2.3 Immersive Gameplay and Visual Elements

Visual and auditory design contribute significantly to the Mahjong Stars experience:

- Theme Selection: Players can choose between traditional themes (e.g., bamboo
  forests, cherry blossoms) and modern designs (e.g., cyberpunk, neon). Seasonal
  themes celebrate holidays or cultural events.
- Dynamic Animations: When players declare melds or wins, animations add
  excitement. Tile movements are smooth and intuitive, preserving the tactile feel of
  physical Mahjong.
- Sound Design: Background music and sound effects complement the themes.
  Players can select sound packs, such as classical Asian instruments or modern
  electronic beats. Voice acting for characters adds personality.
- Camera Angles: Adjustable perspectives allow players to focus on their hand or
  view the entire table. Cinematic replays highlight winning hands from multiple angles.

Together, these elements create an immersive environment that retains the essence of
Mahjong while enhancing it for a digital audience.

## 4.3 Player Progression and Retention

### 4.3.1 Leveling Systems and Al Growth

Progression is an essential component of long-term engagement. Mahjong Stars
incorporates multiple leveling systems:

- Player Level: Reflects overall experience and unlocks new features such as
  advanced tutorials, higher-stake tables and additional clan slots. Leveling up rewards
  players with soft currency, charms or rare characters.
- Character Level: Each character accrues experience through matches. Leveling up
  characters unlocks additional cosmetic options, character-specific emotes and
  increases Al efficiency.
- Al Level: As the Al companion plays more matches, it gains levels. Higher Al levels
  result in faster decision-making, improved risk assessment and better adaptation to
  new strategies. Leveling Al requires both data (from gameplay) and special Al
  modules that can be earned or purchased.

### 4.3.2 Rewards and Loyalty Programs

To incentivise frequent play, Mahjong Stars offers an array of rewards:

- Daily Quests: Simple objectives such as winning a certain number of matches,
  sharing a replay or completing daily tasks.
- Weekly Challenges: Longer-term goals that require strategic planning, such as
  winning with specific hands or reaching a designated rank. Rewards include charm
  bundles or character shards.
- Loyalty Tiers: Players accumulate loyalty points based on consecutive days played
  and total matches. Loyalty tiers unlock benefits like reduced tournament entry fees,
  increased soft currency drop rates and exclusive access to high-rarity raffles.
- Event Passes: Seasonal events introduce event passes, which players can
  progress through by earning experience in matches. Event passes grant unique
  themes, characters or charms. A free tier ensures all players can participate, while a
  premium tier offers extra rewards.
- Clan Rankings: Clans accumulate points based on member performances in ranked
  matches and tournaments. Top clans earn prestige badges, soft currency bonuses
  and the ability to customise clan banners.
- Cross-Region Tournaments: Special events pit regions against one another.
  Winners receive rare assets, and regional pride fosters healthy rivalries.
- Al Leaderboards: Al companions have their own ranking system. Owners compete
  for the most efficient or successful Al, with rankings based on win rates, average
  points per match and risk management. The Al leaderboard encourages players to
  refine their Al training strategies.

These progression and retention mechanisms ensure that Mahjong Stars remains
engaging and rewarding over the long term.

### 4.3.3 Cross-Player Competitions and Ranking

Competitions extend beyond individual play:

- Clan Rankings: Clans accumulate points based on member performances in ranked
  matches and tournaments. Top clans earn prestige badges, soft currency bonuses
  and the ability to customise clan banners.
- Cross-Region Tournaments: Special events pit regions against one another.
  Winners receive rare assets, and regional pride fosters healthy rivalries.
- Al Leaderboards: Al companions have their own ranking system. Owners compete
  for the most efficient or successful Al, with rankings based on win rates, average
  points per match and risk management. The Al leaderboard encourages players to
  refine their Al training strategies.

These progression and retention mechanisms ensure that Mahjong Stars remains
engaging and rewarding over the long term.

## 5 Game Economy and Tokens

The Mahjong Stars economy is designed to balance accessibility with sustainability. By
employing a dual currency system and carefully structured tokenomics, the platform
accommodates different types of players and investors.

### 5.1 Dual Currency System

#### 5.1.1 Soft Currency (In-Game Credits)

Soft currency is either purchased or earned primarily through gameplay and functions as
the day-to-day currency of Mahjong Stars. It is used for:

- Purchasing characters and charms from the primary store.
- Paying table and entry fees for casual tournaments or raffles.
- Accelerating Al training or purchasing Al modules.
- Customising studios with decorations or unlocking theme packs.

Soft currency is designed to be non-speculative. While players can buy soft currency
with fiat or convert tokens into it, the exchange rate is fixed to prevent inflation or
deflation. This ensures that new players are not priced out of the game and that
gameplay remains skill-based rather than pay-to-win.

#### 5.1.2 Hard Currency / Token (Governance and Marketplace)

Alongside soft currency, Mahjong Stars utilises a blockchain-based token that performs
several roles:

- Governance: Token holders can vote on proposals related to game features, Al
  model parameters, tournament rules, economic adjustments and community
  initiatives. Proposals may include adding new Mahjong variants, adjusting character
  drop rates or allocating development budgets. Governance ensures that players and
  investors have a voice in shaping the platform.
- Marketplace Transactions: While characters, charms and studios can be bought
  with soft currency, marketplace transactions for trading these assets are
  denominated in the governance token. This encourages liquidity and allows sellers
  to capture the full value of their assets.
- Staking: Holders can stake tokens to earn rewards, gain access to premium
  features or support network security (depending on the underlying blockchain).
- Al Upgrades: Advanced Al training modules and premium analytics tools may
  require payment in the governance token. This ties the token to core gameplay
  features.

Because the token is issued and managed by a separate company, Mahjong Stars can
operate the game independently of regulatory constraints related to token issuance.
Players who wish to enjoy Mahjong Stars without participating in the token economy are
free to do so.

## 5.2 Utility and Use Cases

The governance token has multiple utility functions beyond basic payment:

- VIP Features: Certain premium features, such as priority access to new characters
  or charm drops, may require holding or staking a minimum number of tokens.
- Exclusive Tournaments: High-stakes tournaments with large prize pools might
  require token entry fees, rewarding experienced players with valuable assets or
  tokens.
- Discounts and Rebates: Staking tokens can reduce marketplace commission fees
  or provide soft currency rebates on purchases.
- Al Marketplace: Players may develop and sell Al models on an Al marketplace.
  Buyers pay in tokens, and the platform takes a small cut. This incentivises skilled
  players to refine and monetise their Al strategies.

## 5.3 Acquisition and Circulation

To maintain a healthy token economy, Mahjong Stars will employ mechanisms for
controlled token supply:

- Initial Distribution: Tokens are allocated among the team, advisors, community
  rewards, treasury and public sale. Vesting schedules ensure team and advisor
  allocations unlock gradually, aligning incentives with long-term project success.
- Earning Mechanisms: Tokens can be earned through gameplay achievements,
  tournament prizes, staking rewards and marketplace trading. A portion of soft
  currency spent on certain features converts into tokens to fund reward pools.
- Airdrops: Airdrops can be given to loyal users and also loyal community members,
  enhancing their relationship with Mahjong whilst demonstrating to them that they are
  rewarded for their time within the ecosystem.
- In-Game: For some specific tournaments or games, there may be a required token
  fee or to have x amount staked. Noting that there are also rewards for the players
  that can be distributed in the form of the native token.

## 5.4 Staking and Rewards

### 5.4.1 Staking Mechanism and Tiers

Staking allows token holders to lock up their assets in exchange for rewards and
privileges. Mahjong Stars offers multiple staking tiers:

- Bronze Tier: Minimum stake threshold; yields modest soft currency rebates and a
  small percentage of marketplace fees.
- Silver Tier: Requires a higher stake; unlocks access to exclusive tournaments and
  reduces entry fees. Token holders at this tier receive a larger share of marketplace
  fees and occasional airdrops of rare charms.
- Gold Tier: Significantly higher stake; grants early access to new character
  releases, priority in Al training queues and premium analytics tools. Gold stakers
  receive the highest percentage of marketplace and tournament fees.

Staking durations can range from 30 days to 1 year, with longer durations receiving
greater rewards. Early unstaking incurs a penalty, promoting stability.

### 5.4.2 Gameplay Rewards and Loyalty Program

Tokens are integrated into the loyalty program, incentivising players to remain active
and engaged. Achievements and loyalty tiers may award small token amounts in
addition to soft currency or charms. These token rewards reinforce the connection
between gameplay and the broader economy.

### 5.4.3 Governance Participation and Voting Rights

Active participants can propose changes to the ecosystem, including game features,
economic adjustments or charitable initiatives. Voting weight is proportional to the
number of tokens held or staked. A governance portal displays proposals, voting
periods and outcomes. To encourage participation, voters may receive small token
bonuses, especially when they vote with the majority.

## 5.5 Marketplace and Store

### 5.5.1 Trading and Liquidity

The in-game marketplace is where players buy and sell characters, charms, studios
and Al modules. Features include:

- Listing Tools: Sellers can set fixed prices or auctions. Auctions may be timed or
  Dutch auctions where prices decrease over time. Listing fees are minimal to
  encourage liquidity.
- Search and Filters: Buyers can search for specific attributes, rarity, level or price
  ranges. Smart filters highlight trending items or undervalued assets.
- Secure Escrow: All transactions are processed via smart contracts, ensuring that
  assets and payment are exchanged simultaneously. Escrow protects both buyer and
  seller from fraud or default.
- Analytics: A dashboard shows historical prices, trading volumes and popular
  assets. Data helps players make informed decisions about when to buy or sell.

The marketplace charges a small commission on each transaction, part of which funds
platform development and part of which is burned.

### 5.5.2 Cosmetic Items and Virtual Assets

Beyond core gameplay items, Mahjong Stars sells purely cosmetic assets such as table
skins, tile sets, emotes and avatar frames. These items enable players to personalise
their experience without affecting gameplay balance. Cosmetic items are sold in limited
editions, seasonal releases or bundles. A portion of cosmetic sales revenue goes
toward community events or charitable causes decided through governance votes.

### 5.5.3 Al-as-a-Service and Monetization Potential

Al-as-a-Service (AlaaS) represents a novel revenue stream:

- Al Rentals: Players with well-trained Al companions can rent them to others. Pricing
  is set by the owner or determined by demand. The platform earns a commission on
  each rental.
- Al Coaching Services: Skilled players can offer one-on-one coaching sessions
  using their Al models. Sessions are booked via the marketplace and paid in tokens.
- Al Templates and Modules: Developers may create Al templates that specialise in
  particular strategies or adapt to specific rule sets. These modules are sold on the
  marketplace, enabling players to enhance their Al companions without intensive
  training.

The AlaaS model rewards players for investing in their Al training and creates a new
sub-economy within Mahjong Stars.

### 5.5.4 Physical Collectibles Exchange

Alongside digital items, Mahjong Stars will occasionally release limited-edition physical
collectibles such as themed mugs, art prints, or other bespoke merchandise—that
celebrate iconic characters and milestones. These items can be purchased using soft
currency via the in-game shop and then listed on a dedicated exchange.

Players who acquire a physical collectible may relist it at a price of their choosing.
Listings operate in an auction-house format where other users can place bids, with the
highest bidder securing the item once the auction period ends. This optional exchange
introduces a tangible dimension to the Mahjong Stars economy, gives collectors a way to
trade unique memorabilia, and encourages long-term engagement without impacting
core gameplay.

Pricing and participation are entirely user-driven, ensuring the experience feels fair and
community-focused rather than commercially coercive.

## 5.6 Revenue Model

Mahjong Stars generates revenue through multiple channels, ensuring sustainability and
diversification:

- Transaction Fees: A small fee is applied to marketplace and Al marketplace
  transactions. This fee is split between the treasury and staking rewards.
- Tournament Entries: Paid tournaments generate prize pools and platform revenue.
  Entry fees may be paid with soft currency or tokens, with a percentage retained by
  the platform.
- Sales of Digital Assets: The primary sale of characters, charms, studios and
  cosmetics provides a significant revenue source. Limited-edition items and seasonal
  themes drive recurring sales.
- Staking Penalties: Early unstaking or penalty fees from governance participation
  feed into the treasury.
- Advertising and Partnerships: Mahjong Stars may partner with brands for in-game
  sponsorships or cross-promotions. Advertising is tasteful and does not disrupt
  gameplay.
- Esports and Media Rights: Broadcast rights for major tournaments, sponsorship
  deals and streaming partnerships can generate additional revenue. Popular events
  attract advertising dollars and enhance the platform's visibility.

The diversified revenue structure ensures that Mahjong Stars remains viable even as
individual revenue streams fluctuate.

## 5.7 Tokenomics and Ecosystem

### 5.7.1 Distribution and Allocation

The total supply of the governance token is fixed at a predetermined amount to prevent
inflation. Allocation is as follows:

| Allocation Category  | Percentage |
| -------------------- | ---------- |
| Pre-Seed             | 3.28%      |
| Seed                 | 6.09%      |
| Private              | 9.38%      |
| KOL                  | 2.25%      |
| Public               | 3.75%      |
| Liquidity            | 9.38%      |
| Team                 | 12.00%     |
| Advisory             | 0.81%      |
| Partnerships         | 2.19%      |
| Reserve              | 7.50%      |
| R&D                  | 2.06%      |
| Operational expenses | 2.20%      |
| Airdrop              | 3.78%      |
| In-Game rewards      | 33.33%     |
| Marketing            | 2.00%      |

### 5.7.2 Vesting Schedules and Lock-Up Periods

To ensure a stable token economy, vesting schedules are implemented:

- Team Tokens: Subject to a multi-year vesting schedule with a cliff period. Tokens
  unlock gradually to prevent sudden sell-offs and demonstrate the team's
  commitment.
- Advisor Tokens: Vested over a shorter period with quarterly releases.
- Community and Staking Rewards: Distributed gradually over time to reward
  long-term participation rather than speculation.
- Treasury Releases: Requires governance approval to access funds, ensuring
  accountability and transparency.

### 5.7.3 Governance and Community Proposals

Token holders participate in governance via an on-chain voting mechanism. Proposal
categories include:

- Introducing new Mahjong rule sets or variants.
- Adjusting marketplace fees or staking rewards.
- Allocating funds for marketing, partnerships or charity events.
- Changing Al parameters or introducing new training modules.

Proposals are submitted through a governance portal and must meet minimum quorum
and majority thresholds to pass. Governance tokens may be delegated to
representatives, empowering passive holders to participate.

### 5.7.4 Reward Token Mechanics

The governance token, also known as reward currency (“MStars”) that functions purely
within the game. MStars are earned through gameplay achievements, tournament
participation and community contributions. They are non-transferable off-platform and
can be redeemed for soft currency, rare assets or special event entries. This secondary
currency ensures that players who prefer not to hold or trade tokens can still participate
fully in the ecosystem.

## 6 Regulatory Alignment and Risk Management

Mahjong Stars is designed and operated as a skill-based digital Mahjong platform that
emphasises strategic decision-making, knowledge of rules, probability assessment, and
competitive play. The platform does not rely on chance-based monetisation
mechanisms, paid outcome manipulation, or wagering structures.

This section outlines the approach taken by Mahjong Stars to align with applicable digital
services and consumer protection frameworks, while managing operational, technical,
and reputational risks in a transparent and proportionate manner. The objective is to
ensure long-term platform sustainability, player trust, and regulatory clarity across
multiple jurisdictions.

### 6.1 Regulatory Positioning and Platform Design

Mahjong Stars is structured around clear design principles that support its classification
as a competitive game of skill rather than a chance-driven product. These principles are
embedded directly into gameplay mechanics and economic systems.

Key design constraints include:

- Absence of stake-based or outcome-dependent payment mechanics
- No monetisation of tile distribution, match outcomes, or randomness
- No purchase mechanisms that influence in-game decision outcomes
- Optional entry fees, where applicable, are solely used to access organised competitive
  formats such as tournaments or structured events

Match outcomes are determined by player decisions, strategic planning, rule
comprehension, and probabilistic reasoning over time. These characteristics are
consistent with internationally recognised definitions of skill-based competitive games,
particularly within the category of traditional mind sports such as Mahjong.

## 6.2 Digital Services Standards and Player Protection

Mahjong Stars applies best practices commonly associated with online games and
consumer digital services to ensure clarity, fairness, and informed participation.

These practices include:

- Clearly defined and publicly documented rulesets for each supported Mahjong variant
- Transparent progression systems, rankings, and reward structures
- Predictable and rule-based access to competitive features
- Optional tools designed to support balanced and sustainable engagement
- Age-appropriate access controls where required by applicable local regulations

These measures are implemented to promote player understanding, long-term
engagement, and trust in the platform's mechanics, rather than to encourage
risk-oriented participation.

### 6.3 Platform Integrity and Operational Risk Management

Maintaining competitive integrity and system reliability is central to the Mahjong Stars
ecosystem. The platform employs a combination of technical architecture and
operational oversight to mitigate potential risks.

Risk management measures include:

- Auditable match records and rule-driven gameplay logic
- Clear separation between core gameplay systems and optional asset or marketplace
  functionality
- Continuous monitoring for abusive behaviour, unauthorised automation, or coordinated
  manipulation
- Incremental rollout of advanced features following testing, validation, and performance
  review phases

These safeguards are designed to protect fair competition, ensure consistent player
experience, and allow for responsible platform evolution as new features are introduced.

### 6.4 Jurisdictional Awareness and Adaptability

Mahjong Stars operates with awareness of the evolving regulatory landscape
surrounding digital entertainment platforms. Ongoing monitoring focuses on
developments related to:

- Online games of skill and competitive digital play
- Digital goods, virtual assets, and online marketplaces
- Consumer protection, data privacy, and user rights

Where jurisdiction-specific requirements apply, access to certain optional or auxiliary
features may be adjusted or restricted to ensure local compliance. Core Mahjong
gameplay functionality remains unaffected and accessible.

### 6.5 Healthy Participation and Long-Term Engagement

Mahjong Stars is designed to encourage positive and sustainable player participation.
Supporting features include:

- Optional session and time-management controls
- Clear communication of gameplay rules and progression mechanics
- Age verification measures where legally required

These features support informed participation and reinforce Mahjong Stars' commitment
to a balanced and responsible player experience.
