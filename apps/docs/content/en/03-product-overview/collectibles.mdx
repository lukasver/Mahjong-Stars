# Collectibles & Digital Assets

True ownership of in-game assets is made possible by Mahjong Stars through optional blockchain technology. The platform allows players to possess, trade and monetize their in-game items if they choose. Players who prefer traditional gaming can keep assets as standard in-game items that still provide gameplay benefits.

<Callout type="info">
**Optional Blockchain**: All collectibles work as traditional in-game assets. Blockchain integration is entirely optional for players who want trading and ownership features.
</Callout>

Collectibles fall into three main categories: **Characters**, **Charms**, and **Studios**.
