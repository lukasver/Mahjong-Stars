# AI Integration

The integration of artificial intelligence sets Mahjong Stars apart from all other Mahjong platforms. Rather than relying on static bots, the platform uses a dynamic AI system that evolves with player input and generates personalised experiences.

<Callout type="success">
**Revolutionary AI**: Mahjong Stars' hybrid AI doesn't just play Mahjong—it learns your style, mimics your strategies, and plays on your behalf 24/7.
</Callout>

## AI-Assisted Gameplay and Strategy Hints
