The name "SWR" is derived from `stale-while-revalidate`, a HTTP cache
invalidation strategy popularized by
[HTTP RFC 5861](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5861). SWR is a strategy to first
return the data from cache (stale), then send the fetch request (revalidate),
and finally come with the up-to-date data.

<Callout emoji="🏆">
With SWR, you can enhance key aspects of user experience in web applications:

- **Fast** and **reactive**: Data is loaded immediately from cache while background revalidation occurs.
- **Auto Revalidation**: Data automatically updates when users switch between tabs or network connectivity is restored.
- **Real-time**: Data updates in real-time when the source changes.
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript support with generic types.
- **REST & GraphQL**: Supports both REST and GraphQL APIs.
- **Pagination & Infinite Loading**: Helps handle paginated and infinite scrolling lists.
