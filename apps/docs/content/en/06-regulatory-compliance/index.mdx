# Regulatory Compliance & Risk Management

Mahjong Stars is designed and operated as a skill-based digital Mahjong platform that emphasises strategic decision-making, knowledge of rules, probability assessment, and competitive play. The platform does not rely on chance-based monetisation mechanisms, paid outcome manipulation, or wagering structures.

This section outlines the approach taken by Mahjong Stars to align with applicable digital services and consumer protection frameworks, while managing operational, technical, and reputational risks in a transparent and proportionate manner.

<Callout type="info">
**Core Principle**: The objective is to ensure long-term platform sustainability, player trust, and regulatory clarity across multiple jurisdictions.
</Callout>

## Regulatory Positioning and Platform Design

Mahjong Stars is structured around clear design principles that support its classification as a **competitive game of skill** rather than a chance-driven product. These principles are embedded directly into gameplay mechanics and economic systems.

### Key Design Constraints

The platform operates under strict design constraints:

- **No Stake-Based Mechanics**: Absence of stake-based or outcome-dependent payment mechanisms
- **No Outcome Monetization**: No monetisation of tile distribution, match outcomes, or randomness
- **No Pay-to-Win**: No purchase mechanisms that influence in-game decision outcomes
- **Optional Entry Fees**: Where applicable, entry fees are solely used to access organised competitive formats such as tournaments or structured events

<Callout type="success">
**Skill-Based Classification**: Match outcomes are determined by player decisions, strategic planning, rule comprehension, and probabilistic reasoning over time.
</Callout>

### International Standards Alignment

These characteristics are consistent with internationally recognised definitions of skill-based competitive games, particularly within the category of traditional mind sports such as Mahjong.

**Regulatory Considerations**:
- Classified as skill-based competition, not gambling
- Comparable to chess, poker tournaments, and esports
- Focus on strategic decision-making and player skill
- Transparent and predictable game mechanics
- Fair competition standards
