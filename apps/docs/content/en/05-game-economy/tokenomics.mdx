# Tokenomics and Ecosystem

The Mahjong Stars token economy is carefully designed to balance various stakeholder interests while ensuring long-term sustainability and growth.

## Distribution and Allocation

The total supply of the governance token is fixed at a predetermined amount to prevent inflation and maintain scarcity.

## Vesting Schedules and Lock-Up Periods

To ensure stable token economy and align incentives long-term, vesting schedules are implemented for most allocations.

### Team Tokens (12%)

**Vesting Terms**:
- **Total Duration**: 4 years
- **Cliff Period**: 1 year (no tokens released)
- **Release Schedule**: Monthly linear vesting after cliff
- **Rationale**: Demonstrates long-term commitment

**Example Timeline**:
- Month 0-12: 0% released (cliff period)
- Month 13: 2.08% released (1/48 of total)
- Month 14-48: 2.08% released monthly
- Month 48: 100% vested

**Team Alignment**:
- Incentivizes 4+ year commitment
- Prevents early dumps
- Aligns team with long-term success
- Industry-standard practice

### Advisor Tokens (0.81%)

**Vesting Terms**:
- **Total Duration**: 2 years
- **Cliff Period**: 6 months
- **Release Schedule**: Quarterly after cliff
- **Rationale**: Shorter term than team but still locked

**Release Schedule**:
- Months 0-6: 0% (cliff)
- Month 9: 16.67% (first quarter post-cliff)
- Quarterly releases: 16.67% each
- Month 24: 100% vested

### Investor Tokens (Pre-Seed, Seed, Private: 18.75% total)

**Vesting Terms Vary by Round**:

**Pre-Seed (3.28%)**:
- 6-month cliff
- 2-year linear vesting

**Seed (6.09%)**:
- 3-month cliff
- 18-month linear vesting

**Private (9.38%)**:
- 3-month cliff
- 12-month linear vesting

**Rationale**: Earlier investors have longer locks, rewarding risk-taking

### Partnership Tokens (2.19%)

**Custom Vesting**:
- Negotiated per partnership
- Typically 12-24 months
- Performance-based unlocks possible
- Strategic alignment focused

### Community and Staking Rewards (33.33%)

**Gradual Release**:
- **Duration**: 5-7 years
- **Schedule**: Decreasing annual amounts
  - Year 1: 10% of allocation (33.3M tokens)
  - Year 2: 15% (50M tokens)
  - Year 3: 20% (66.6M tokens)
  - Year 4: 20% (66.6M tokens)
  - Year 5: 15% (50M tokens)
  - Year 6-7: Remaining 20% (66.7M tokens)

**Dynamic Adjustment**:
- Rewards scale with platform activity
- Can accelerate if user growth exceeds targets
- Can decelerate if needed for sustainability
- Governed by community votes

<Callout type="warning">
**Long-Term Distribution**: Community rewards released over 5-7 years ensures tokens remain scarce and valuable throughout platform growth.
</Callout>

### Treasury Releases (Reserve: 7.5%, R&D: 2.06%, Operations: 2.20%)

**Governance Controlled**:
- **Approval Required**: Token holder vote for major spends (>1% of treasury)
- **Transparent**: All spending publicly tracked
- **Accountability**: Quarterly reports to community
- **Emergency Reserve**: Portion locked for critical situations

**Use Cases**:
- Development funding
- Marketing campaigns
- Strategic acquisitions
- Legal and compliance
- Emergency liquidity

| **Critical Changes** | 20% of circulating supply | 75% supermajority |
