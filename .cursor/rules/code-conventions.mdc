# Code Conventions

This project follows specific coding conventions to ensure consistency and maintainability.

## TypeScript Conventions

- Avoid using `any`. Prefer `unknown` instead when type is uncertain
- Use JSDoc to document functions, classes, and methods
- One export per file

## Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for classes
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables
- Start each function with a verb
- Use verbs for boolean variables (e.g., isLoading, hasError, canDelete)
- Use complete words instead of abbreviations

## File Structure

- Component files should match the component name
- Component directories should include an index.ts file
- Use feature-based organization for complex features

## Testing

- Use vitest for unit & integration testing framework.
- Use playwright for e2e testing when applicable.
- Tests should be in a `__tests__` directory.

## Documentation

- Provide clear and concise comments for complex logic
- Use JSDoc comments for functions and components to improve IDE intellisense
